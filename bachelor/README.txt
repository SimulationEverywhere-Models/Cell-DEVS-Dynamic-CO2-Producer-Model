Dynamic CO2 Producer Expation simulation was implemented and tested in Linux ubuntu terminal using the CD++ toolkit.
The following will be a description of the folder organisation, followed by step to run each simulation using the CD++ tool kit.

/***************************************/
Folder Organisation

README -> instructions.
CD++ -> Toolkit needed to run the simulations. DO NOT MOVE

Simulation Folders:
	- bachelor.ma -> CD++ implementation of the simulation. Set of rules for each cell 
	- bachelor.pal -> colour pallet for simulation visualization tool
	- bachelor.val -> Initial simulation values that structures the simulation cell layout and CO2 generator starting location 
	- in.log -> simulation output file
	- run_co2Mod.sh -> shell scrip to run the simulation
/***************************************/
Instructions

1. Open terminal in simulation folder of the wanted simulation

2. Run the following command: bash run_co2Mod.sh

3. refer to previous README for visualization instructions
